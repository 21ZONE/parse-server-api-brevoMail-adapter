[Full Changelog](https://github.com/mtrezza/parse-server-api-mail-adapter/compare/1.0.0...1.0.1)
### 🐛 Fixes
- Removed unused config parameter from docs. [#1](https://github.com/mtrezza/parse-server-api-mail-adapter/pull/1). Thanks to [mtrezza](https://github.com/mtrezza)

### 🧬 Improvements
- ⚠️ Added locale to API callback. This is a breaking change because the `apiCallback` now returns an object `{payload, locale}` instead of only the `payload`. [#2](https://github.com/mtrezza/parse-server-api-mail-adapter/pull/2). Thanks to [mtrezza](https://github.com/mtrezza)
- Added badges to readme. [#3](https://github.com/mtrezza/parse-server-api-mail-adapter/pull/3). Thanks to [mtrezza](https://github.com/mtrezza)
